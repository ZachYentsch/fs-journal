## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
Primary keys are pieces of unique information that are used to identify records on a table. They must be unique and cannot contain null values.
Foreign Keys are used to reference another table by telling this table where to look.

2. What is an `Alias`?
An alias is when there are 2 values being brought in under the same name so bandaid a new name for one of the properties to something else so you can save the data simultaneously.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
SELECT d.*, p.*, dr.*
FROM doctors d
JOIN patients p ON p.id = d.patientId
JOINN doctors dr ON dr.id as = dr.doctorsId
```
