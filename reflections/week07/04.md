## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
I implemented pair programming this week and UX this week. Although it was hard to keep switching and back and forth for the pair programming


2. What went well this week?
Our server went well, this week. Another thing that went well was our timeboxing. If we didn't timebox well, we definately would not have made it as far.

3. What would you do differently?
On monday both my partner and I had to work on checkpoint from last week, If we both past it first try and was able to just focus on this project starting monday. We would have been completely done.
