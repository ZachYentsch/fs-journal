## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
The purpose of async / await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs. The behavior of async / await is similar to combining generators and promises. Async functions always return a promise. If the return value of an async function is not explicitly a promise, it will be implicitly wrapped in a promise.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
Try and catch methods
3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
Cleaner syntax with fewer brackets, making debugging easier Error handling is better; try..catch can be used in the same way it is used in synchronous code.
