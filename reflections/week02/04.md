## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
To help guide your project along. To keep you on a path of what to do next. To not feel so lost when starting out.


2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
Utilize google, better googling skills are good. Also I will look back on what I did the past week and reference my notes.


3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways? Don't obsess about performance or appearance. I definately did that on my checkpoint, and I was just happy to get it done.
