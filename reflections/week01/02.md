## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use.
A pseudo-class is a phantom state or a specific characteristic of an element that can be targeted with css. The most common ones I think I might use are :link, :hover, :first-child, and :nth-child

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is the ability to determine which rule should be applied in the off chance that that the element and property are targeted by different values. I can use it to my benefit by knowing that a class selector beats any number of element selectors.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
If the !important feature is overutilized, I think it will lead to infinite loops going on if they are caught messing with the same element.
