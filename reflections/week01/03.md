## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design? My personal favorite tip is shadows and offsetting shadows. It completely changes the design and makes it ten times better.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas. Is important information bold? Are shadows used and offset? Is there extra spacing between groups of elements? Is there 2 different background colors for distinction.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone? Good design influences people to continue to visit that website or show somebody who increases online traffic to that site. You can convey emotion or something appeasing to the eyes of the viewer.
