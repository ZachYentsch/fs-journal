## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
I am using Geo Json, Stripe and fire base technologies in my project today.

2. What went well so far?
Just getting functionality in my project to work. Really has been going well for me
3. What would you do differently? Why?
I would have maybe done my own Capstone from the start. Instead of working with a team. IT would have given me more time to get farther on my assignment and do better.
