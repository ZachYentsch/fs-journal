## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
A row is all the data for one object and column is the same parameter for every object. For example x|y|z
            x|y|z
the x's are in the same column 
xyz is the row.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY COMMENT '',
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL COMMENT '',
    age VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL COMMENT '',
    description  VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL COMMENT ''
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

Delete from drops an object in the table.
Drop Deletes all the objects in the table and the table.
```
