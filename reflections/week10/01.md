## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
The three categories of data types are Value, Reference, and Pointer.
The Value Type holds data within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.
The Reference type is unlike any value type. It doesnt store any value directly and references where the data can be found.
The Pointer type calls the reference.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Bool, Byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short , struct, uint, ulong, and ushort. 
These differ from JavaScript because js has string number Bigint symbol boolean undefined and null

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
References types get stored somewhere outside of internal memory. The request gets made and it leads to where it actually is stored. Value types give store data in the memory space and call to that when a request is made.
