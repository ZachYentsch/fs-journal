## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums are strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values. Some cases are directions like north, south, east, west, and integers 1, 2, 3, 4.

2. How can you modify an Enum?
declare the enum then : string
turns everything to a string
: int makes everything integers.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I have. On my capstone I used an enum for status. pending, declined, accepted, or cancelled.
