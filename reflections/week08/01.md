## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
A Developers Portfolio acts as their resume. It is a showcase proving that you can do what you say you can do. It is a way of Showing rather than telling an employer.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
A portfolio that is effective is one that is simple. People only want to see a few not all your applications that you built. They also want to see that you can user Experiance into account. They will predominantly be the ones using your app after all. It is also a way to make a first good first impression on people. When they look you up and see what you have done. They should be pleased.


3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
When the capstone is done I would like to add that project to my portfolio. The aspects that my group and I are attacking just seem really cool to me and that is why I would add it to my Portfolio. Another Project Is Site clone. I took the time on that one to get the colors and the CSS to my liking. That was one of the more fun ones and I really thought it looked good.
