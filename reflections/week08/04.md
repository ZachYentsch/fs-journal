## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
In Vue we can accomplish Unit Testing allows you test individual units of code in isolation, Componet Testing is done by mounting the componet to the DOM and testing it to see if its fully working, and End-2-End Testing Provides coverage on What Actually Happens When a User Uses Your Application. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I feel like they are pretty equally useful on their own. The key to testing is to incorporate all 3 to your application. This is where you can get the most beneficial data returned. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
If I had to isolate one completely it would be E2E just because if you write all this code and don't test it until the very end. You better hope it was all good to begin with.
